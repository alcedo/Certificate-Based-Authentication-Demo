## 2024-12-19: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build a Certificate-Based Authentication Demo application targeting developers who need to learn practical implementation of mutual TLS authentication. The demo will include both Node.js server and client implementations with self-signed certificates, comprehensive documentation, and educational materials to teach the end-to-end authentication flow.

### Context

Developers frequently struggle with implementing certificate-based authentication due to:
- Lack of complete, working examples
- Complex setup procedures and configuration
- Difficulty understanding the authentication flow
- Scattered documentation that focuses on theory rather than practice

We want to help developers learn certificate-based authentication by providing a complete, working demo application that includes both server and client implementations with self-signed certificates.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Basic Tutorial Documentation**
   - Pros: Quick to create, low maintenance
   - Cons: Doesn't provide working code, limited learning value

2. **Enterprise-Grade Implementation**
   - Pros: Production-ready, comprehensive features
   - Cons: Too complex for learning, requires extensive infrastructure

3. **Multi-Language Implementation**
   - Pros: Broader audience appeal, comprehensive coverage
   - Cons: Increased complexity, longer development time

### Rationale

Chose the complete demo approach because:
- Provides immediate hands-on learning experience
- Fills a clear gap in available educational resources
- Balances educational value with practical implementation
- Can be extended incrementally with advanced features
- Self-contained environment reduces setup barriers

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Developers get working code they can run immediately
- Clear learning path from basic concepts to implementation
- Foundation for more advanced certificate management topics
- Reusable patterns for production implementations

**Negative:**
- Limited to Node.js ecosystem initially
- Self-signed certificates may not reflect all production scenarios
- Requires ongoing maintenance and updates

## 2024-12-19: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use Node.js for both server and client implementations with Express.js framework, self-signed certificates, and RESTful API design.

### Context

Need to select technologies that:
- Are widely adopted and familiar to developers
- Provide good certificate handling capabilities
- Enable clear, readable code for educational purposes
- Support both server and client implementations

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Python with Flask/FastAPI**
   - Pros: Clear syntax, good for education
   - Cons: Less common for production APIs

2. **Java with Spring Boot**
   - Pros: Enterprise standard, robust certificate handling
   - Cons: More verbose, steeper learning curve

3. **Go with standard library**
   - Pros: Excellent TLS support, simple deployment
   - Cons: Less familiar to many web developers

### Rationale

- Node.js is widely adopted in web development
- Express.js provides simple, clear API patterns
- Native HTTPS module has good certificate support
- Single language for both server and client reduces complexity
- Large ecosystem of security-related packages

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Familiar technology stack for most web developers
- Rich ecosystem for additional security features
- Good documentation and community support
- Easy to extend with additional features

**Negative:**
- Limited to JavaScript ecosystem
- May not demonstrate patterns for other languages
- Node.js-specific certificate handling approaches

## 2024-12-19: Educational Approach

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Education Team

### Decision

Focus on comprehensive educational experience with detailed documentation, extensive code comments, structured logging, and step-by-step tutorials rather than minimal working example.

### Context

Need to balance simplicity for learning with completeness for practical understanding. Educational resources should enable developers to understand not just how to implement, but why each step is necessary.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Minimal Working Example**
   - Pros: Quick to understand, easy to maintain
   - Cons: Lacks depth, doesn't teach best practices

2. **Production-Ready Implementation**
   - Pros: Real-world applicable, comprehensive
   - Cons: Too complex for learning, overwhelming for beginners

### Rationale

- Educational value is the primary goal
- Developers need to understand the 'why' behind each implementation choice
- Comprehensive examples serve as better reference material
- Detailed logging helps debug authentication issues

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Higher educational value and learning outcomes
- Better foundation for production implementations
- Serves as comprehensive reference material
- Demonstrates security best practices

**Negative:**
- More complex codebase to maintain
- Longer development time
- May be overwhelming for complete beginners
