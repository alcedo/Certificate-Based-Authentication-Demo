# Product Mission (Lite)

Certificate-Based Authentication Demo is an educational application that helps developers learn certificate-based authentication by providing a complete working example with both server and client implementations using self-signed certificates.

This demo serves software developers and security engineers who need practical examples of mutual TLS authentication implementation. Unlike theoretical documentation, our solution provides a complete working system with automated certificate generation, clear code examples, and step-by-step instructions that enable immediate hands-on learning without complex infrastructure setup.
