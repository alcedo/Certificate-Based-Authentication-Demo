# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-15-core-mvp-functionality/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Certificate Generation
- Generate self-signed Certificate Authority (CA) with 2048-bit RSA key
- Create server certificate signed by CA with Subject Alternative Names (SAN) for localhost
- Generate client certificate signed by CA for mutual authentication
- All certificates must be in PEM format with 365-day validity period
- Certificates stored in `/certs` directory with proper file permissions (600)

### Server Implementation
- Express.js HTTPS server listening on port 8443
- Require client certificate presentation using `requestCert: true` and `rejectUnauthorized: false`
- Custom middleware to validate client certificate against CA
- Certificate validation includes: signature verification, expiration check, and CA chain validation
- Structured logging using console with timestamp, request ID, and certificate details
- Graceful error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes (401, 403, 500)

### API Endpoint
- GET `/api/hello` endpoint requiring valid client certificate
- Returns JSON response: `{"message": "Hello! Certificate authentication successful", "clientCert": {certificate_details}}`
- Include client certificate subject and issuer information in response
- Request/response logging for debugging and educational purposes

### Client Implementation
- Node.js HTTPS client using native `https` module
- Load client certificate and private key from `/certs` directory
- Present certificate to server during TLS handshake
- Handle server responses and display authentication results
- Error handling for connection failures, certificate errors, and HTTP errors

### Security Requirements
- All communication over HTTPS with TLS 1.2 minimum
- Private keys protected with appropriate file permissions
- No hardcoded certificates or keys in source code
- Certificate validation follows RFC 5280 standards
- Proper error messages without exposing sensitive certificate details

### Documentation Requirements
- README.md with step-by-step setup instructions
- Code comments explaining certificate validation logic
- Example output showing successful and failed authentication attempts
- Troubleshooting section for common certificate issues

## External Dependencies
