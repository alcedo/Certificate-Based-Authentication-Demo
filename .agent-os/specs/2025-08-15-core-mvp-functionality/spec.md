> Spec: Core MVP Functionality
> Created: 2025-08-15

## Overview

Implement the foundational certificate-based authentication system with automated certificate generation, secure HTTPS server, and demo client application. This MVP will provide developers with a complete working example of mutual TLS authentication that they can run locally and learn from.

## User Stories

### Developer Learning Certificate Authentication

As a software developer, I want to run a complete certificate-based authentication demo, so that I can understand how mutual TLS works in practice and implement it in my own applications.

The developer will clone the repository, run setup scripts to generate certificates, start the server, and execute the client to see successful authentication. They will be able to examine the code, modify certificates, and observe authentication failures to understand the security model.

### Security Engineer Teaching Team

As a security engineer, I want to demonstrate certificate-based authentication to my development team, so that they can implement secure API authentication in our microservices.

The security engineer will use this demo in workshops and training sessions, showing the complete authentication flow, explaining certificate validation, and demonstrating security best practices through working code examples.

## Spec Scope

1. **Certificate Generation Scripts** - Automated creation of self-signed CA, server, and client certificates with proper extensions and validity periods
2. **HTTPS Server with Certificate Validation** - Express.js server that requires and validates client certificates for API access
3. **Hello World API Endpoint** - Simple authenticated endpoint that returns success message upon valid certificate presentation
4. **Demo Client Application** - Node.js client that presents certificates and calls the authenticated API endpoint
5. **Certificate Validation Middleware** - A simple easy to understand Server-side logic that verifies certificate authenticity, validity, and proper chain of trust when a client calls the API endpoint.
6. **Basic Error Handling** - Proper error responses for invalid certificates, expired certificates, and missing certificates
7. **Setup Documentation** - Clear README with installation instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting guide

## Out of Scope

- Certificate revocation lists (CRL) or OCSP validation
- Integration with external certificate authorities
- Web-based user interface or dashboard
- Database storage for certificates or users
- Advanced certificate rotation or renewal
- Production deployment configurations
- Multi-language client implementations

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Successful Certificate Authentication Flow** - Client can authenticate to server using generated certificates and receive successful API response
2. **Certificate Generation Automation** - Running setup script creates all necessary certificates without manual intervention
3. **Clear Authentication Failure Handling** - Server properly rejects invalid certificates with descriptive error messages that help developers understand what went wrong
